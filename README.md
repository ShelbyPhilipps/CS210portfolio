--Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.--
This project gave us "the chance to become familiar with integrating C++ and Java using the Java Native Interface (JNI). Being able to integrate multiple languages gives you the ability to create more secure and efficient programs by leveraging the strengths of each language on the same system."

--What did you do particularly well?--
During this assignment there were very particular instructions which made it seem to not be difficult. However, I ran into a lot of system specific issues when trying to do a similar project on my own time with this method. I wanted to see if I could use this project and implement something similar on my own time. I ran into a lot of issues and I am proud of how I went in on my own time to deeper understand the project. 

--Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?--
With this particular assignment, I think I could have gone above and beyone by adding my own touch to the existing code. 

--Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?--
Identifying the correct path for this assignment was the most difficult thing. Becuase I was not familar with the VM file directory, I was using the wrong path. I overcame my issue by finding out the correct path for my system by doing a little digging. 

--What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?--
Out of all the projects we did in the class, this one stood out to me as being signifigantly useful. I have seen people implement different languages together but I had never done so myself. Because I have seen this during small jobs and such, I know it will be applicable when moving forward. 

--How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?--
In order to make this project more maintainable I went back and made my own version on my personal machine. By ensurig that I understood the process, I can now not only maintain my code for future use but also my mind for if I need this in the future.
